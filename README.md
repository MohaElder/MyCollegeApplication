# MyCollegeApplication
## To see me and others' college app packages, go to [wiki](https://github.com/MohaElder/MyCollegeApplication/wiki) tab and check them out.

*Feel free to star this project~*

The purpose of this project is to help out the juniors applying to colleges by taking a look at my college application package. But be aware, you can't just directly determine what kind of college you are going to get into by looking at my package. You can't just say that you are not going to get into UCSD because your SAT score is lower than mine, or that you are guaranteed to go to Princeton because all your GPA, Test Scores, and activities are better than mine, both are pure bullshit. There are so many parameters for college application. Parameters like GPA, SAT, Toefl and stuff are all structured data where it's tangible whereas activities and essays are unstructured data where you gotta figure it out by yourself. Still, you can get an idea of what college application is like and how people's essays went from shit to less shit. 

Good luck on your college applications!

You may also use whatever data in this repo to do some kind of statistic work or deep learning dataset. Just like MIT License has mentioned, do whatever the fuck you want.
